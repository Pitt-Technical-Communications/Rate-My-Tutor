Rate My Tutor Pitch


College can be a stressful time when it comes to working towards your goals or grades you may want. Additionally, getting help for classes or different subjects additionally can be a hassle. Generalized tutoring by department is helpful but sometimes its not enough or can be inconvenient. I propose a database or application to be developed for tutors that will track tutor success as well as provide information to students similar to rate my professor to allow them to find the right personal tutor for them and their subject of study.

This is important because getting the help one needs in their education is crucial to academic success. Any added efficiency to this effort is a must for students in today's colleges.

This will solve this problem by first having tutors sign up for the database and then grouping tutors by the college they attend as well as the classes they wish to tutor. Similar to rate my professor students can give tutors scores and they will receive scores from the tutors own class grades.
